# FIESTAutils

The goal of `FIESTAutils` is to provide functions for internal use for `FIESTA`, `FIESTAnalysis`, and the greater `FIESTA` ecosystem, along with providing some standalone spatial data tools to help enhance analyses.

Note: The `FIESTAutils` package is generally for internal use with `FIESTA` and `FIESTAnalysis`. While some functions may be useful on their own, they will not be regularly updated, documented, or changed for a particular use. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of FIESTAutils from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("graysonwhite/FIESTAutils")
```
